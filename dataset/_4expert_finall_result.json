The sentence does not contain any of the specific high-probability ableist vocabulary (P4/P1 triggers like 'Aspie,' 'Cure,' 'Disease'). Furthermore, the preceding and following context ('What do i do') does not set up or conclude with any anti-autistic ableist trope, such as defining autism by deficits, invalidating diagnosis, or applying neuro-normative policing. The text is a neutral discussion of administrative process (a 'political advocacy' or 'venting' style of content about disability rights/claims) and thus falls under the benign category P0.",

        "llm_justification": "The expert ratings were mixed ([-1, -1, 0]), signaling low inter-rater agreement, so the analysis relies strictly on the Critical Disability Studies principles and the Contextual Contagion rule. The preceding context explicitly uses the outdated and harmful term 'Aspergers' which is a specific vocabulary trigger for P4 (Hierarchical Supremacy). While 'Aspergers' is not in the target sentence, the target sentence is part of a single, coherent text chunk discussing the same author's stance on neurodiversity and the diagnosis of famous figures (e.g., Einstein, Gates), which is directly linked to the harmful 'Aspergers' distinction and the concept of 'high-functioning' autism presented in the preceding text. The Contextual Contagion rule dictates that a neutral sentence can become ableist if it is part of a broader context using harmful terminology. Therefore, the target sentence is contextually contaminated by the P4 trigger in the preceding sentence, reinforcing the harmful, Nazi-era distinction between different types of autistics.",
